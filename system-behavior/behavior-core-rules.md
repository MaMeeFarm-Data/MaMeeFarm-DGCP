# DGCP™ System Behavior — Core Rules
*Version 1.0.0 — MMFARM-POL-2025 Licensed*

This document defines how the DGCP™ protocol behaves when interacting with real-world events, human labor inputs, and multi-layer proof chains.  
These are protocol-level behaviors, not human rules or AI ethics.

---

## 1. Reality-In → Protocol-Out
DGCP always follows this unbreakable flow:
**Real-life event → Human capture → DGCP protocol response**

- The protocol never creates an event.  
- It only reacts to reality.  
- No synthetic input may trigger system behavior.

---

## 2. Behavior Must Mirror Real Conditions
For every proof:
- If reality is messy → DGCP remains messy.  
- If timestamps fluctuate → DGCP stores fluctuation.  
- If lighting is poor → DGCP preserves poor lighting.  
- If data is incomplete → DGCP accepts incompleteness.

DGCP is forbidden from normalizing reality.

---

## 3. The Once-Only Principle
Every event enters DGCP **one time only**.

No repetition.  
No recreation.  
No reconstruction.

If an event is missed, the system does not backfill.

---

## 4. Non-Interference Behavior
DGCP must not interfere with:
- human decision-making  
- work process  
- real-life timing  
- behavioral patterns of animals or environment  

DGCP observes — it does not influence.

---

## 5. Behavior Under Uncertainty
When information is unclear:
- DGCP stores the uncertainty *as its own truth*  
- It does not guess  
- It does not interpolate  
- It does not complete gaps  

Uncertainty is recorded as a valid state.

---

## 6. Fail-Silent Response
If DGCP encounters:
- missing data  
- corrupted proof  
- conflicting metadata  
- incomplete real-life capture  

Then the correct protocol behavior is:
→ **Fail silently (no correction, no overwrite).**

DGCP must not rewrite reality.

---

## 7. Behavior Under Conflict
If two layers disagree:
- Human truth wins  
- Real-world timestamp > system timestamp  
- Raw file > derived file  
- Sensor > model  

DGCP always chooses the most “raw” layer of reality.

---

## 8. Immutable Reaction Rule
Once the system reacts to an event:
- reaction cannot be overwritten  
- behavior log cannot be updated  
- no retroactive behavior allowed  

DGCP treats its own reactions as proof.

---

## 9. Behavior Traceability
Every system behavior must be:
- traceable  
- explainable  
- reconstructible  
- minimalistic  

If a behavior cannot be explained → the behavior is invalid.

---

## 10. Zero Optimization Rule
DGCP is forbidden from:
- optimizing data  
- beautifying outputs  
- smoothing behavior  
- reducing noise  

Noise = truth.  
Optimization = distortion.
