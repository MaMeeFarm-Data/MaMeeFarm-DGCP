# DGCP™ System Behavior — Incomplete Proof Behavior
*Version 1.0.0 — MMFARM-POL-2025 Licensed*

This document defines how DGCP™ behaves when proofs are incomplete, partially missing, or lacking context.

Real farms, real lives, and real work are rarely “perfectly documented.”  
DGCP must honor that reality.

---

## 1. Incomplete ≠ Invalid

A proof can be incomplete and still:

- valid  
- useful  
- meaningful  

DGCP must not discard proofs simply because they are imperfect.

---

## 2. Explicit Incompleteness Marking

When a proof is incomplete, DGCP should:

- mark which parts are missing:
  - missing photo  
  - missing timestamp  
  - missing temperature  
  - missing narrative  
- avoid pretending that the proof is complete.

Clarity is more important than perfection.

---

## 3. No Backfilling with AI

DGCP must never:

- ask AI to fill missing data  
- auto-generate missing measurements  
- fabricate descriptions to “complete” the proof

What is missing stays missing.

---

## 4. Partial Promotion Behavior

If an event is only partially understood:

- DGCP may still promote it to a proof  
- annotate that some fields are unknown  
- avoid blocking the entire chain due to gaps.

---

## 5. Behavior Under Fragmented Evidence

If a proof is spread across:

- multiple devices  
- multiple files  
- multiple days of input  

DGCP must:

- link fragments without forcing them into a fake single perfect object  
- maintain traceability of each fragment.

---

## 6. Human Explanation Layer

Humans may later add:

- explanations  
- clarifications  
- context  

DGCP may attach these as **secondary layers**,  
but must not overwrite original incomplete state.

---

## 7. Chain Continuity Behavior

Incomplete proofs:

- must not break chain continuity  
- can be part of the same day / project / NFT sequence  
- are treated as “honest missingness,” not failure.

---

## 8. Incomplete but Critical Proofs

If an incomplete proof documents a critical reality:

- injury, loss, extreme weather, survival decision, etc.  

DGCP may highlight its importance in governance or analysis,  
without trying to “fix” its gaps.

---

## 9. Auditability of Missing Parts

DGCP must support questions like:

- “What is missing in this proof?”  
- “Was it ever present and then corrupted?”  
- “Has anyone attempted to complete it?”  

The history of incompleteness must itself be traceable.

---

## 10. Alignment with Human Dignity

Incompleteness often reflects:

- exhaustion  
- poverty  
- limited tools  
- survival priorities  

DGCP must treat incomplete proofs with respect,  
not as technical failures.
