# DGCP™ System Behavior — Event-to-Proof Behavior
*Version 1.0.0 — MMFARM-POL-2025 Licensed*

This document describes how DGCP™ behaves when transforming events into formal proofs.

Events are raw.  
Proofs are structured.

DGCP must never falsify reality during this transformation.

---

## 1. Eligibility for Proof

An event becomes a **proof candidate** when:

- it reflects real-world work, observation, or condition  
- it contributes to understanding life, labor, or environment  
- a human declares: “this matters enough to preserve as proof”

DGCP does not auto-promote events to proofs without human intent.

---

## 2. Non-Destructive Structuring

When converting event → proof:

- DGCP may **add structure**,  
  but must not remove or alter original meaning.  

Allowed:
- adding fields  
- adding metadata  
- organizing content  

Forbidden:
- rewriting descriptions  
- altering measurements  
- removing inconvenient details  

---

## 3. Proof Granularity Behavior

DGCP must allow:

- one event → one proof  
- one event → multiple proofs (if multiple aspects are deeply meaningful)  
- many events → one proof (if they logically belong together)

Granularity is decided by human judgment, not by optimization.

---

## 4. Behavior Under Ambiguity

If it is unclear:

- whether an event should become a proof  
- what category of proof it belongs to  
- which chain it should connect to  

DGCP may:
- mark it as “pending human decision”  
- store it safely  
- avoid forced proof creation

No auto-classification into proof-type is allowed.

---

## 5. Proof Chain Binding

Once an event becomes a proof:

- bind it to:
  - day proof chain  
  - thematic or project chain (e.g. 7 Ducks of Hope, Seed of Hope)  
  - governance / analysis chain (if any)  

Binding is append-only and must be reversible in explanation  
(but not deletable in history).

---

## 6. Behavior for Multi-Layer Proof

Some proofs have multiple layers (image, text, metadata, JSON, NFT, CID):

- DGCP must keep:
  - original event  
  - layered proof components  
  - relationships between layers  

A missing layer must not be silently replaced by an AI-generated one.

---

## 7. Human Declaration Priority

If the worker states:

- “this is only an event, not a proof”  
- “this is a major proof, not just a casual event”

DGCP must respect this declaration and treat the object accordingly.

---

## 8. Proof Rejection Behavior

If an event **fails** eligibility as proof:

- DGCP keeps it as event  
- records reason for non-promotion (if provided)  
- does not delete or hide it  

Non-proof events are still part of the historical record.

---

## 9. Event-to-Proof Traceability

For every proof, DGCP must answer:

- “Which event(s) did this proof come from?”  
- “What changed when event became proof?”  
- “Who decided this event was proof-worthy?”

If this cannot be answered, the proof is structurally weak.

---

## 10. Alignment with Governance & Licensing

All event-to-proof behavior must:

- follow Human-First Governance  
- comply with MMFARM-POL-2025  
- preserve Real-Work dignity  

Proofs are not mere data products.  
They are formalized fragments of real life.
