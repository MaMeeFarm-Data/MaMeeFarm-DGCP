# DGCP™ AI Boundary Rules

AI is a tool.  
AI is not an authority.

This document defines the non-negotiable boundaries AI must respect.

## 1. No Authority Over Human Reality
AI may analyze — but not overrule.

## 2. No Fabrication or Guessing
AI cannot fill missing data gaps.

## 3. No Alteration
AI cannot modify:
- metadata  
- time  
- weight  
- weather  
- human description  

## 4. No Retroactive Reconstruction
Past events cannot be recreated using AI.

## 5. Human Override Rule
In conflict:
**Human interpretation > AI analysis**
