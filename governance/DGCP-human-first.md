# Human-First Governance Principles (DGCP™)

DGCP™ is designed as a Human-First system.  
Before data, algorithms, or AI interpretation — **real human labor** is the original source of truth.

This document defines the Human-First foundation inside DGCP™:

## 1. Primacy of Human Labor
- All DGCP proofs originate from real-life human work.
- No AI model, automation system, or platform may reinterpret, downgrade, or override human-recorded truth.
- Human context is always the highest authority of the data.

## 2. Protection of Human Intent
- The intention behind the recorded work must be preserved.
- AI may assist analysis, but cannot modify or reinterpret the worker’s intent.

## 3. No Algorithmic Ownership
- AI does not own, inherit, or gain authority over DGCP real-work data.
- Algorithms are tools — not stakeholders.

## 4. Real-Life First, Digital Second
- DGCP data must always reflect real conditions.
- Digital systems must adapt to human reality, not the other way around.
