# DGCP™ Data Safety & Human Protection Protocol

Data safety means human safety.

## 1. Zero Harm Principle
No DGCP dataset may cause harm, judgment, or discrimination toward the human producer.

## 2. Sensitive Context Protection
DGCP hides details that could expose:
- vulnerability  
- poverty  
- health struggles  
- location risk  
without losing truth.

## 3. No Weaponization of Data
No one can use DGCP data to damage:
- livelihood  
- identity  
- dignity  

## 4. Review-on-Risk Rule
If a proof might cause harm, human review is required.

## 5. Digital Safety Before Public Access
Human safety > Public transparency
