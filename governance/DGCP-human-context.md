# Context Preservation Rules

Real-work data is meaningless without real human context.  
DGCP™ therefore enforces strict rules ensuring that context is never lost.

## 1. Mandatory Human Context
Every proof must include:
- real location  
- real timestamp  
- real environmental condition  
- human description of the activity  
- purpose of the task  

## 2. No AI Reconstruction
AI cannot:
- fill missing context,
- guess unknown intent,
- recreate events,
- alter environmental data.

## 3. Human Verification
Only the worker who performed the labor can confirm:
- accuracy
- intention
- meaning
- interpretation

## 4. Recorded Once, Interpreted Many Times
The truth is created once by human labor.  
Other systems may analyze — but cannot overwrite.
