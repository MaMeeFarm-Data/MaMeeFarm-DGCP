# DGCP™ Governance Hierarchy  
*Version 1.0.0 — MMFARM-POL-2025 Licensed*

This document defines the hierarchy of governance inside DGCP™, determining 
which rules override others and how authority is structured.

---

## 1. Hierarchy Overview

DGCP Governance is structured as:

1. **Core Principles (highest)**
2. **Human-First Governance**
3. **Truth Preservation / Anti-Fake Invariants**
4. **System Behavior Governance**
5. **Proof Protocol Rules**
6. **Metadata & Schema Definitions**
7. **Implementation Guidelines (lowest)**

Rules lower in the hierarchy must obey rules above them.

---

## 2. Core Principles (Level 1 — Supreme Layer)

These may never be overridden:

- Human-first  
- Reality-aligned  
- No optimization  
- No rewriting history  
- Once-only principle  

This is DGCP’s “constitution.”

---

## 3. Human-First Governance (Level 2)

Overrides:
- AI Boundary rules  
- system interpretations  
- metadata conflicts  

Human truth > system behavior

---

## 4. Anti-Fake Invariants (Level 3)

Prevent:
- reconstruction  
- synthetic content  
- truth distortion  

Overrides metadata or schema if conflict appears.

---

## 5. System Behavior Rules (Level 4)

Define:
- how protocol reacts  
- event flow logic  
- error containment  

These rules cannot contradict Level 1–3.

---

## 6. Proof Protocol Rules (Level 5)

Define:
- proof creation  
- proof linkage  
- chain continuity  

Must respect Levels 1–4.

---

## 7. Metadata & Schema (Level 6)

Lowest structural level for data processing.

If schema conflicts with human truth → schema must change.

---

## 8. Implementation Notes (Level 7)

Guides for developers, AI tools, and integrations.

Never allowed to influence truth or override governance.

---

## 9. Authority Mapping

Authority = flows from human → truth → governance → protocol → tools  
Never the reverse.

---

## 10. Update Path

Any update to the hierarchy must:
- follow Meta-Governance rules  
- document reasoning  
- never alter recorded reality
