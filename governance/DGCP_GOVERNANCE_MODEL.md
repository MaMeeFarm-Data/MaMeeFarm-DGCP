# DGCP™ Governance Model — Human-First, Federated Oversight (v1.0.0)
**License: MMFARM-POL-2025**  
**Data Governance & Continuous Proof™**

The DGCP™ Governance Model defines how truth is verified, how conflicts are resolved, and how Real-Work Data (RWD) is protected across regions, cultures, and economic conditions.

This governance model is built on one fundamental principle:

> **Machines verify structure. Humans verify meaning.**

---

## 1. Purpose of Governance
The DGCP™ protocol must guarantee:
- **Truth** (human-interpreted, not machine-scored)  
- **Fairness** (workers are not exploited or silenced)  
- **Continuity** (Proof chain remains unbroken through SHA256 + DLT anchors)  
- **Impartiality** (multi-region federated oversight prevents centralized abuse)

Governance exists to **protect humans from machine bias**  
and **protect data integrity from human manipulation**.

---

## 2. Governance Layers
DGCP governance has three explicit layers.

### **2.1 Layer 1 — Machine Validation (Minimal, Zero Interpretation)**
The Validator checks only:
- schema compliance  
- signature validity  
- CID structure  
- git commit integrity  

**It explicitly must NOT:**
- interpret descriptions  
- classify work  
- score work  
- judge truth  

This preserves the Human-First Promise.

---

### **2.2 Layer 2 — Local Human Audit Group**
Every region/community operating DGCP forms a Local Audit Group.

Responsibilities:
- Verify context (weather, location, work type)  
- Compare descriptions with media (ipfs_cid_primary)  
- Maintain fairness  
- Prevent abuse, fraud, or coercion  
- Support workers without literacy or technical skills  

Audit must be conducted with **respect, empathy, and transparency**.

---

### **2.3 Layer 3 — Federated Global Audit**
When proofs affect cross-regional outcomes (supply chain, trade, certification), disputes escalate to a federated group.

Rules:
- Each region = 1 vote  
- No region may dominate  
- Human consensus overrides machine signals  
- Resolutions must be transparent and publicly referenceable  

This ensures global fairness without centralized power.

---

## 3. Authority Boundaries

### **Machine Authority (LIMITED)**
Allowed:
- Verify structure (DMS compliance)
- Verify signatures
- Validate CID format
- Confirm git chain continuity

Forbidden:
- Meaning interpretation  
- Classification  
- Labor scoring  
- “Truth prediction” models  

### **Human Authority (MAXIMUM)**
Allowed:
- Interpret meaning  
- Contextualize work  
- Resolve disputes  
- Override machine-level outcomes  
- Adapt governance rules to culture and local norms  

---

## 4. Governance Ethics
DGCP governance follows four ethics pillars:

1. **Worker-Centric**
   - No surveillance  
   - No biometric coercion  
   - No hardware requirement beyond a phone  

2. **Interpretable**
   - Every decision must be explainable  
   - No black-box scoring  

3. **Transparent**
   - Public audit logs (without PII)  
   - Referenced by SHA256 + DLT timestamps  

4. **Non-Extractive**
   - Data belongs to the worker  
   - Protocol does not monetize without consent  

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution Model

1. **Local Review** → worker + local audit  
2. **Regional Panel** → if disagreement persists  
3. **Federated Global Review** → for cross-border disputes  

Every resolution must include:
- reference commit SHA256  
- reference IPFS CIDs  
- reference human interpretations  
- non-PII supporting context  

---

## 6. Governance Anchoring
Governance decisions should be anchored to:

- GitHub SHA256 commits  
- OTS/Bitcoin timestamp  
- Public indexers that mirror the repo  

This creates a public, verifiable, immutable governance trail.

---

## 7. Why This Governance Model Works
- Protects humans from machine abuse  
- Protects integrity from human corruption  
- Culturally adaptable  
- Globally verifiable  
- Zero-cost and zero-infrastructure burden  
- Ethical and auditable at every step  

DGCP™ governance ensures the protocol remains:
- **Human-first**  
- **Fair**  
- **Global**  
- **Tamper-proof**  
- **Future-proof**
