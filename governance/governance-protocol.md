# DGCP IP Governance Protocol  
Version 1.0 (2025)

This document defines how intellectual property, ownership,  
and data rights are governed within the DGCP protocol.  
DGCP is built entirely from real-life events and real human labor.  
Because of this, the information recorded here carries context,  
effort, and lived truth.

IP governance exists to protect that truth.

## 1. Ownership of Data
All real-life data, labor logs, proof units, daily events, metadata,  
and derived information within DGCP are owned by:

**P’Toh — MaMeeFarm  
Lampang, Thailand**

Ownership includes:
- daily real-life event capture  
- PoLIFE, PoLABOR, and PoHW data  
- timestamps, hashes, metadata  
- verification records  
- IPFS references, GitHub commits, and NFT-linked proofs  
- any future data created as part of daily work

No third party may claim authorship or ownership of these records.

---

## 2. Non-Rewrite Principle
Historical records cannot be:
- edited  
- corrected  
- replaced  
- cleaned  
- reconstructed from memory  
- simulated later  

Every event reflects something that happened once.  
DGCP protects that once.

## 3. Allowed Uses
You may:
- read and study DGCP  
- learn from its structure  
- research or reference it  
- build similar systems for education or non-commercial purposes  

---

## 4. Prohibited Uses
You may NOT:
- extract DGCP data to commercial datasets  
- use DGCP data to train AI models for profit  
- resell or repackage DGCP records  
- host DGCP data as if it is your own  
- create synthetic versions of DGCP data claiming to be originals  

---

## 5. Attribution Requirements
Any public or academic reference must cite:

**“DGCP Protocol by MaMeeFarm (P’Toh)”**

Attribution must be visible and permanent.

---

## 6. Governance Updates
All governance changes must:
- be recorded in `changelog.md`  
- never alter past meanings  
- only apply to future data  
- preserve the integrity of the original truth  

DGCP updates, but history stays.

---

## 7. Closing Notes
DGCP governance is simple by design.  
It protects the rights of the human who created the work,  
and ensures that truth cannot be rewritten or owned by machines.
