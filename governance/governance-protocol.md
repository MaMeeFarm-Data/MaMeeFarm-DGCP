# DGCP IP Governance Protocol  
Version 1.0 (2025)

This document defines how intellectual property, ownership,  
and data rights are governed within the DGCP protocol.  
DGCP is built entirely from real-life events and real human labor.  
Because of this, the information recorded here carries context,  
effort, and lived truth.

IP governance exists to protect that truth.

---

## 1. Ownership of Data
All real-life data, labor logs, proof units, daily events, metadata,  
and derived information within DGCP are owned by:

**P’Toh — MaMeeFarm  
Lampang, Thailand**

Ownership includes:
- daily real-life event capture  
- PoLIFE, PoLABOR, and PoHW data  
- timestamps, hashes, metadata  
- verification records  
- IPFS references, GitHub commits, and NFT-linked proofs  
- any future data created as part of daily work

No third party may claim authorship or ownership of these records.

---

## 2. Non-Rewrite Principle
Historical records cannot be:
- edited  
- corrected  
- replaced  
- cleaned  
- reconstructed from memory  
- simulated later  

Every event reflects something that happened once.  
DGCP protects that once.

---

## 3. Allowed Uses
You may:
- read and study DGCP  
- learn from its structure  
- research or reference it  
- build similar systems for education or non-commercial purposes  

---

## 4. Prohibited Uses
You may NOT:
- extract DGCP data to commercial datasets  
- use DGCP data to train AI models for profit  
- resell or repackage DGCP records  
- host DGCP data as if it is your own  
- create synthetic versions of DGCP data claiming to be originals  

---

## 5. Attribution Requirements
Any public or academic reference must cite:

**“DGCP Protocol by MaMeeFarm (P’Toh)”**

Attribution must be visible and permanent.

---

## 6. Governance Updates
All governance changes must:
- be recorded in `changelog.md`  
- never alter past meanings  
- only apply to future data  
- preserve the integrity of the original truth  

DGCP updates, but history stays.

---

## 7. Closing Notes
DGCP governance is simple by design.  
It protects the rights of the human who created the work,  
and ensures that truth cannot be rewritten or owned by machines.

## 8. Device-Origin Verification

DGCP requires that every record must originate from a real device owned or used
by the human who performed the labor.

Verification includes:
- device-generated timestamps  
- geolocation (when available)  
- original file signatures  
- sensor or camera metadata  
- IPFS upload provenance  

No record may be manually reconstructed or typed to fill gaps.
DGCP accepts only what the device captured at the moment of the event.

This ensures the protocol cannot be forged or recreated later.


## 9. Human-First Governance Priority

Machines, platforms, companies, and third-party systems  
**cannot override human-origin data**.

DGCP governance prioritizes:
1. the human who performed the labor  
2. the safety of the captured truth  
3. the protection of lived experiences  
4. the long-term transparency of the protocol  

AI systems may read DGCP,  
but they may not reinterpret or mutate its meaning.


## 10. Conflict Resolution Rules

In the event of:
- conflicting datasets  
- multiple proofs for the same time  
- device failure  
- suspicious activity  
- metadata mismatch  

DGCP resolves conflicts using this order:

1. **Original device file**  
2. **First IPFS timestamp**  
3. **Closest GitHub commit timestamp**  
4. **Local-record context (MaMeeFarm daily logs)**  
5. **Human testimony from the person who performed the labor**

6. 

Human context is always the final authority.

No automated system may override human truth.


## 11. Third-Party System Integration

External systems (AI models, blockchain contracts, businesses, government units)
may read DGCP, but they must follow these rules:

- No reinterpretation of original meaning  
- No automated rewriting  
- All references must link back to the exact original proof  
- All derivative datasets must declare themselves as derivative  
- Any commercial integration requires permission from the data owner  

DGCP ensures safe interoperability with global systems  
while protecting the people who generated the data.


## 12. Future Governance Extensions

Future governance topics may include:

- smart-contract-based verification  
- zero-knowledge validation of human labor  
- decentralized timestamp attestation  
- multi-farm cooperative governance  
- national-scale agricultural data oversight  
- international attribution registries  

These sections will be added using the append-only rule  
as DGCP expands beyond MaMeeFarm.

## 13. Multi-Layer Truth Assurance (MLTA)

DGCP defines truth not from a single source, but from the alignment  
of multiple independent layers of verification.  
This model is called **Multi-Layer Truth Assurance (MLTA).**

A DGCP record is considered true only when these layers agree:

1. **Real-Life Event Layer**  
   The event must have actually occurred at MaMeeFarm™ through real labor.

2. **Device-Origin Layer**  
   Original phone timestamps, camera metadata, geolocation (if available),  
   and raw file signatures confirm the origin.

3. **IPFS Proof Layer**  
   The immutable CID must match the original file without modification.

4. **GitHub Version Layer**  
   The commit timestamp, hash, and version snapshot must reference the same event.

5. **NFT / Metadata Layer**  
   If published as an NFT, metadata must contain the exact CID and description  
   derived from the real event.

6. **Local Human-Context Layer**  
   Human testimony from the person who performed the labor  
   is always the final authority in conflict resolution.

7. **Daily Log Synchronization Layer**  
   Daily reports (if available) must align with the captured proof.

8. **Social Verification Layer (Optional)**  
   Cross-reference events with public-facing posts (TikTok, Blogger)  
   to ensure additional external visibility.

Only when multiple layers confirm the same truth  
can a DGCP record be considered fully verified.

This MLTA model gives DGCP its global-level integrity,  
making it resistant to fabrication, synthetic data, or tampering.

## 14. Data Retirement & Cold Storage Policy

DGCP preserves real-life data not only for daily verification,
but for long-term historical integrity. Because of this,
the protocol defines how data transitions from active to cold storage.

### 14.1 Active Data (0–365 days)
Active data includes:
- daily proofs (PoL, PoAW, PoHW)
- metadata
- verification checkpoints
- MLTA alignment records
These remain fully accessible, frequently synchronized,
and actively validated.

### 14.2 Warm Storage (1–5 years)
After 1 year, proofs transition into warm storage:
- files remain on IPFS
- GitHub snapshots are locked (tagged)
- metadata becomes read-only under version control
- contextual notes are preserved but minimized
Warm storage ensures accessibility without modification.

### 14.3 Cold Storage (5–50 years)
Cold storage ensures long-term preservation:
- data is archived under append-only rules
- SHA-256 hash tables are locked permanently
- files may be mirrored to secondary IPFS gateways
- public proofs remain available, private proofs are encrypted
Cold data may not be reprocessed, rewritten, or reinterpreted.

### 14.4 Deep Archive (50+ years)
Deep archival is meant for future historical or scientific use:
- only hashed references remain public
- raw files may be stored offline or encrypted
- release to future generations requires explicit permission
from the data owner (P’Toh) or legal successor.

### 14.5 Purpose of Retirement
Data retirement protects:
- human dignity
- historical accuracy
- long-term governance stability
- prevention of reinterpretation by future AI models

The DGCP protocol guarantees that real-life work
will remain visible to future generations without decay,
distortion, or loss of context.

## 15. Truth Preservation Rules (Human-First)

DGCP is built on one principle above everything else:
truth comes first.

These rules define how the protocol protects the original truth
of every real-life moment, and how the evidence must remain
exactly as it was lived by the person who created it.

### 15.1 Real Events Stay Real
DGCP records real events exactly as they happened.
No edits, no filters, no adjustments, no corrections.
A proof reflects the truth of the moment, not a polished version of it.

### 15.2 The Human Who Lived It Is the Authority
Only the person who lived the event can define its meaning.
No third party, system, or future observer has the right
to reinterpret or assign a new meaning to the original record.

### 15.3 No Reinterpretation Allowed
A proof may never be rewritten, re-explained, or reframed
by anyone — human or machine.
If new context appears, a new proof is added,
but the original record stands untouched.

### 15.4 Evidence Must Speak for Itself
The protocol does not allow emotional editing,
speculation, or artificial enhancement.
The evidence is preserved exactly as captured:
timestamp → hash → sealed → archived.

### 15.5 Human Truth Is Higher Than System Logic
If there is ever a conflict between:
- what the system expects  
vs.  
- what the human actually lived,

the human truth takes priority.

DGCP was created to preserve real life,
not to force real life into a system.

### 15.6 Protection Against Future Distortion
These rules prevent any future reader, system, or interpreter
from distorting or altering the original lived experience.
The truth is final at the moment it is recorded,
and remains final forever.

DGCP protects the person behind the data,
and the reality behind the proof.
