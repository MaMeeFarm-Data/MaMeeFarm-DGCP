# DGCP™ Reality Integrity Shield

DGCP guarantees the integrity of lived human reality.

## 1. Single-Source Real-Life Events
Events are recorded *once* by the human worker.  
No synthetic reconstruction is permitted.

## 2. No Systemic Distortion
Systems cannot:
- adjust timestamps  
- alter environmental data  
- smooth inconsistencies  
- optimize for aesthetic or coherence  

Real life is imperfect — DGCP preserves that imperfection.

## 3. No Narrative Correction
If reality looks “messy,” it stays messy.

## 4. Integrity Over Convenience
DGCP does not allow data cleaning that destroys truth.
