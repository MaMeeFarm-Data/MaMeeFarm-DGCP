# DGCP — Anti-Fake-Data Invariants  
**Version 1.0 — 2025**  
**MaMeeFarm™ — DGCP Governance**

DGCP establishes a series of structural invariants that make it 
impossible for fake data, manipulated data, synthetic AI content, or 
post-edited historical reconstructions to enter the verified chain of 
Real-Work Data (RWD).

These invariants form the backbone of DGCP’s global data-ethics model 
and ensure that human truth remains the highest authority.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of the Anti-Fake-Data Invariants is to:

- prevent fabricated events from entering DGCP  
- prevent synthetic or AI-generated media from replacing real evidence  
- prevent future AI from rewriting human history  
- guarantee long-term trust between humans, AI systems, and institutions  
- maintain an immutable record of lived reality  

DGCP exists to preserve **real life**, not a reconstructed version of it.

---

## 2. Zero-Synthetic Rule

DGCP prohibits the following:

- AI-generated photos  
- AI-generated videos  
- AI-generated events  
- deepfakes  
- altered files  
- regenerated metadata  

Only original, device-captured evidence is allowed.

Any proof containing synthetic elements is automatically rejected from the DGCP chain.

---

## 3. Device-Bound Authenticity Invariant

Every accepted proof must originate from:

- a real human  
- a physical moment  
- a device with internal timestamp  
- raw EXIF metadata  

DGCP assumes that **the device itself is the root of truth**, not the platform.

If EXIF is missing, corrupted, or intentionally stripped,  
the proof is placed under “Integrity Review” and cannot be verified without secondary evidence.

---

## 4. Single-Moment Capture Invariant

DGCP prohibits:

- staged re-creations  
- repeated captures of the same event  
- post-event reconstruction  

The proof must reflect **the single moment as lived**.

Even the creator may not re-create or attempt to “beautify” the original event,  
because DGCP prioritizes **reality over presentation**.

---

## 5. No Retroactive Editing Invariant

Once evidence is captured and uploaded:

- no editing  
- no cropping  
- no retouching  
- no filter  
- no color correction  
- no background modification  

DGCP accepts “raw truth,” not “improved truth.”

If cropping is necessary for privacy,  
the unmodified original must remain preserved on IPFS as Tier-2 evidence.

---

## 6. Append-Only & Non-Rewrite Invariant

No file, metadata entry, or narrative within DGCP may be:

- rewritten  
- replaced  
- overwritten  
- deleted  

Corrections must appear as:

- new entries  
- new proofs  
- new notes  
- new CIDs  

DGCP follows the same principles as blockchain,  
but applies them to human life instead of financial transactions.

---

## 7. CID-Integrity Invariant

Each CID represents:

- content identity  
- historical truth  
- hash-based uniqueness  

If the content behind a CID changes (which is impossible by design),  
DGCP automatically treats the proof as invalid.

CID = identity.  
Changing the content = destroying the identity.

This invariant prevents all forms of fake replacement.

---

## 8. Multi-Layer Verification Invariant

DGCP uses a layered defense system:

1. **Human Reality (Tier 0)**  
2. **Device-captured timestamp & EXIF (Tier 1)**  
3. **IPFS CID + SHA-256 (Tier 2)**  
4. **Append-only GitHub logs (Tier 3)**  
5. **Future Smart-Contract Anchors (Tier 4)**  

Any mismatch between layers results in immediate rejection.

Fake data cannot bypass all layers simultaneously.

---

## 9. AI-Interpretation Protection Invariant

Future AI models must not reinterpret human truth.

DGCP requires:

- fixed timestamps  
- fixed metadata  
- fixed narrative context  
- no retroactive reinterpretation  

Once recorded,  
**the truth is final and permanently binding**.

AI must adapt to the human record —  
not the other way around.

---

## 10. Governance Integration

This file is officially part of:

- governance-protocol.md  
- DGCP Declaration 2025  
- DGCP Web3 Verification Layer  
- DGCP Lifecycle Rules  

All DGCP systems must enforce these invariants  
to prevent fake data from entering humanity’s shared truth.

---

## 11. Closing Statement

DGCP exists to protect human truth in a world where fake, synthetic, and 
algorithmic realities continue to rise.

These invariants make DGCP one of the most tamper-resistant  
real-life data systems in the world.

**Real humans. Real work. Real proof.**
