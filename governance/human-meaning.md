# DGCP™ Meaning Preservation Charter
Human meaning is the highest form of truth.  
No system or AI interpretation can override what the human worker meant.

## 1. Meaning Before Metrics
DGCP prioritizes:
- feelings  
- intention  
- situation  
- difficulty  
over numerical metrics.

## 2. Subjective Truth Is Still Truth
Human emotional context is considered valid data.

## 3. No Meaning Reconstruction by AI
AI cannot:
- rewrite emotional truth  
- reframe human difficulty  
- reinterpret purpose  

## 4. Meaning is Part of the Proof
A proof without meaning is incomplete.
