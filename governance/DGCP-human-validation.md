# Human Validation Layer (HVL)

Human verification is the highest authority inside DGCP™.

## 1. Human-Confirmed Truth
A proof becomes part of DGCP only after human confirmation.

## 2. AI Cannot Override
No model may:
- question the human experience,
- change the meaning of the work,
- reinterpret the intention,
- auto-correct human truth.

## 3. Disagreement Rule
If human truth and AI inference conflict:
**Human truth wins.**

## 4. Reason Visibility
AI must show how it reached its analysis; hidden inference is not allowed.
