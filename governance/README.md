# Governance (IP Governance)

This folder contains the Intellectual Property Governance documents  
for the DGCP protocol.

DGCP real-life data is created through real human work, and therefore  
the ownership, rights, and responsibilities of this data must be  
defined clearly.

The documents in this folder describe:
- who owns the data  
- what rights others have  
- what cannot be rewritten  
- how attribution must be handled  
- how governance updates are applied  

This section protects the truth inside DGCP.
