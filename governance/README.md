# Governance (IP Governance)

This folder contains the Intellectual Property Governance documents  
for the DGCP protocol.

DGCP real-life data is created through real human work, and therefore  
the ownership, rights, and responsibilities of this data must be  
defined clearly.

The documents in this folder describe:
- who owns the data  
- what rights others have  
- what cannot be rewritten  
- how attribution must be handled  
- how governance updates are applied  

This section protects the truth inside DGCP.
# Governance (IP & Data Governance)

This folder defines the governance structure that protects the truth, origin, 
and integrity of all data inside the DGCP protocol.

DGCP is built from real human labor.  
Therefore the ownership, rights, responsibilities, and update policies of this data  
must be defined with absolute clarity.

The governance documents in this folder explain:

---

## 1. Data Ownership
- All real-life data captured at MaMeeFarm™ is owned by the person who performed
  the labor that created it.
- DGCP does not allow any external party—company, government, AI model, or platform—
  to claim ownership over the original labor-based data.
- Copies or derivatives must acknowledge the original source.

---

## 2. Rights and Limitations
- Data may be studied, referenced, and analyzed.
- Data may not be renamed, rewritten, or altered from its original state.
- Commercial use without permission is prohibited under the MMFARM-POL-2025 License.
- AI training on this dataset must follow the attribution and usage rules.

---

## 3. Immutable Records
Because DGCP represents real life, events happen once.
Therefore:
- No historical record may be modified.
- No proof may be re-uploaded or replaced retroactively.
- Corrections must be added as new append-only entries, never as edits.

This immutability protects the truth of the protocol.

---

## 4. Attribution Requirements
Any use of DGCP data must credit:

**DGCP Protocol by MaMeeFarm (P’Toh)**

Attribution must appear in:
- research papers  
- smart contracts  
- AI datasets  
- documentation  
- commercial tools built on top of DGCP  

---

## 5. Governance Updates
- All changes to DGCP governance must be documented publicly.
- Governance updates follow the append-only rule:
  - new policy = added  
  - old policy = never deleted  
- Every governance change must include:
  - date  
  - author  
  - reason  
  - impact  

This ensures the protocol remains transparent and traceable.

---

## 6. Purpose of Governance
The purpose of this folder is to protect:
- the people who performed the labor  
- the truth of the captured data  
- the ability to verify the data forever  
- the long-term continuity of the DGCP protocol  

Governance is the guardian of truth inside DGCP.
