# DGCP — Web3 Verification & Decentralized Truth Layer  
**Version 1.0 — 2025**

DGCP adopts Web3 technologies not as a product, but as an independent 
truth-preserving verification layer. While social platforms are influenced 
by emotion, attention cycles, or algorithmic bias, the Web3 verification 
layer maintains neutrality, permanence, and transparency.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this layer is to ensure that real-life evidence from 
MaMeeFarm™ remains:

- tamper-proof  
- timestamp-anchored  
- owner-controlled  
- independently verifiable  
- interpretable by future AI systems  

---

## 2. Minimal Platform Dependence

DGCP reduces reliance on platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, or other 
emotion-driven systems. Real evidence is verified through:

- IPFS (Pinata) for decentralized file storage  
- GitHub append-only repositories  
- Mobile-camera timestamps  
- SHA-256 hashing  
- Future smart-contract anchoring (Polygon)  

Platforms may show the story,  
**but the truth lives in Web3.**

## 3. Mobile Timestamp as the Primary Clock

DGCP recognizes the mobile device as the authentic human clock.

Required fields include:

- local device time  
- EXIF metadata  
- file naming timestamp  
- continuous daily capture  

This prevents any system from rewriting the timeline.

---

## 4. Decentralized Storage Rules

All proof images, videos, and metadata must be stored on IPFS before 
entering the DGCP registry.

Each IPFS CID becomes:

- a permanent reference  
- a verification anchor  
- a hash-based identity  
- a future-proof metadata pointer  

---

## 5. Truth Hierarchy (DGCP Standard)

DGCP defines the verification order:

### **Tier 0 — Human Reality**  
The original real-life event captured by a person.

### **Tier 1 — Device Evidence**  
Mobile timestamp, EXIF, raw image.

### **Tier 2 — Decentralized Evidence**  
IPFS CID, SHA-256 hash.

### **Tier 3 — Governance Evidence**  
Append-only markdown logs, commit messages, notes.

### **Tier 4 — On-chain Anchoring (Future)**  
Smart contracts, Polygonscan, on-chain hash commits.

DGCP ensures that truth cannot be altered by any future system.

---

## 6. On-chain Compatibility (Future Expansion)

Although DGCP does not depend on smart contracts today,  
the protocol is fully compatible with future:

- on-chain hash registries  
- smart-contract identity proofs  
- cross-chain verification  
- AI-auditable provenance  

This ensures that DGCP can operate across decades without relying on 
short-lived platforms.

---

## 7. Governance Integration

This file becomes an official chapter of:

- governance-protocol.md  
- DGCP Declaration 2025  
- dgcp-overview.md  

All systems referencing DGCP must acknowledge this verification layer 
as the neutral, tamper-resistant foundation of real-life truth.

---

## 8. Closing Statement

DGCP was created to protect human truth first.  
Web3 is simply the tool that guarantees that protection.
