# DGCP™ Meta-Governance Specification  
*Version 1.0.0 — MMFARM-POL-2025 Licensed*

Meta-Governance defines **how DGCP™ governance itself may be changed, upgraded, corrected, or extended.**  
It is the governance of governance.

---

## 1. Governance Change Principles

A governance rule may only be changed when:

1. The change does not violate core truth principles.  
2. The change does not rewrite or erase existing human reality.  
3. The change improves clarity, safety, or human-first protection.  

No external party (AI, platforms, companies) may change rules.

---

## 2. Amendment Tiers

DGCP supports 3 tiers of amendments:

### **Tier 1 — Minor Clarification**
- Adds clarity without changing meaning.
- May be appended without version bump.

### **Tier 2 — Structural Update**
- Changes structure or processes.
- Requires versioning update.

### **Tier 3 — Fundamental Amendment**
- Affects system principles or rights.
- Requires human-led justification and chain documentation.

---

## 3. Change Process

1. Draft proposal  
2. Human review  
3. Version impact analysis  
4. Approval (human-first decision)  
5. Commit with traceable rationale  
6. Propagation to governance model  

AI may assist drafting but cannot approve.

---

## 4. Immutable History

All governance changes must preserve:

- prior versions  
- decision reasoning  
- human authorship  
- timestamp chain  

Nothing may be deleted.

---

## 5. Emergency Governance Actions

In extreme conditions:
- severe data corruption  
- external attack  
- system-wide anomaly  

DGCP may temporarily activate **Emergency Governance Mode**:

- freeze writes  
- isolate affected data  
- require human override only  

After resolution, the emergency decision must be documented.

---

## 6. Governance Versioning

Meta-Governance relies on versioning rules defined in `versioning.md`:

- semantic versioning  
- clear changelog  
- human-signed updates  

Governance must always be transparent.

---

## 7. Alignment to Core Principles

Meta-Governance may never override:

- Human-first rules  
- Data truth preservation  
- Anti-fake invariants  
- Reality-aligned behavior rules  

If conflict appears → **Core Principles win**.
