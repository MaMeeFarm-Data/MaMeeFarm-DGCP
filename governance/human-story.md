# DGCP™ Human Story Protection Act

Every DGCP proof is a piece of human life.  
It is not just data — it is a human story.

## 1. Story is a Protected Asset
Every description, struggle, and lived experience is protected.

## 2. No Narrative Extraction
Researchers and AI cannot take the story and:
- monetize it  
- repurpose it  
- remove identity from context  

## 3. Story Fidelity Rule
The worker's story must remain honest, unedited, and respected.

## 4. The Human Story is Non-Fungible
Two human lives cannot be substituted.

## 5. DGCP as a Life Archive
This protocol is not “big data.”  
It is a **living record of human survival and dignity.**
