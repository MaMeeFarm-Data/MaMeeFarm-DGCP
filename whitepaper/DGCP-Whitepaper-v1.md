# DGCP Whitepaper  
Version 1.0 (2025)  
MaMeeFarm™ — Lampang, Thailand  

## Abstract
DGCP (Duck Governance & Continuous Proof) is the world’s first  
real-life data protocol built entirely from daily human work,  
unfiltered events, and verifiable lived experience.

Unlike synthetic datasets, DGCP captures reality as it happened,  
combining three layers of truth:
- PoLIFE — real-life conditions  
- PoLABOR — human effort  
- PoHW — integrated proof of human work  

DGCP introduces a new category of data:  
**Human-Origin Truth** — data that can be traced to a real person  
doing real work in a real environment.

This whitepaper defines the purpose, principles, structure, and  
future direction of DGCP.

## 1. Introduction

Modern AI systems are built on synthetic or anonymous datasets.  
These datasets lack context, human origin, and traceability.  
DGCP solves this by grounding data in lived human work.

DGCP was born at MaMeeFarm, Lampang, Thailand, where daily  
agricultural work produces continuous truth.  
This truth becomes structured evidence inside the protocol.

DGCP is not theory.  
It is a protocol built from actual life.

## 2. Motivation

Human work is disappearing from the digital world.  
AI is accelerating, but the people who live the work  
are not represented in the data.

DGCP returns value to the real worker.

Motivations:
- protect human-origin truth  
- preserve real-world data integrity  
- provide verifiable evidence of daily work  
- allow AI to learn from real life, not simulations  
- establish ownership for workers and small creators  

DGCP is a response to a world that forgot who creates the real work.

## 3. System Architecture Overview

DGCP is composed of four layers:
1. **PoLIFE** — real-life event and environmental truth  
2. **PoLABOR** — physical work performed by humans  
3. **PoHW** — combined human work unit  
4. **DGCP Governance Layer** — protects rights, rules, structure  

Each layer has strict rules for:
- data formatting  
- verification  
- traceability  
- immutability  

The architecture ensures that truth cannot be rewritten.

## 4. Core Principles

### 4.1 Human-Origin  
All data must come from lived human work.

### 4.2 Single-Capture Rule  
Events and labor can only be recorded once.

### 4.3 Immutable Evidence  
Historical truth is never rewritten.

### 4.4 Open Study, Limited Use  
DGCP can be studied freely, but cannot be commercialized  
without explicit permission.

### 4.5 Attribution  
All use must credit:  
**“DGCP Protocol by MaMeeFarm (P’Tōh)”**

## 5. Data Flow and Verification

DGCP data flows through:
1. Real-life capture  
2. Device metadata  
3. GitHub (public evidence layer)  
4. IPFS (permanent storage)  
5. DGCP Proof (hashes, timestamps)  
6. Optional NFT records  

Verification includes:
- timestamp  
- SHA-256 hash  
- source information  
- immutability check  

---

## 6. Future Directions

DGCP will expand to:
- multi-farm human work networks  
- real-life data cooperatives  
- high-traceability AI datasets  
- government-scale work verification  
- on-chain identity linking  
- smart-contract proof of labor  

DGCP is designed to scale beyond MaMeeFarm  
while preserving its human-centered origin.

---

## 7. Closing Statement

DGCP is the first protocol built not from code,  
but from real human life.

It is a living system,  
growing one day, one duck, one action,  
one human proof at a time.
