## 1. Overview  
This file contains the **official metadata JSON** for:

**DGCP™ — Official Protocol Identity Cover (2025 Edition)**

This metadata represents the identity artifact of the DGCP protocol.  
It anchors the narrative, technical lineage, and verification layers of the entire system.

DGCP™ (Duck Governance & Continuous Proof™) is the world’s first real-life data protocol built directly from a survival-driven event at MaMeeFarm™.  
Real animals lived, vanished, suffered, and survived — and their evidence required a system that **cannot lie**.

This artifact establishes:
- the **protocol’s origin**,  
- the **data species**,  
- the **proof mechanics**, and  
- the **multi-layer verification stack**.

It is the identity cover of a protocol that is **append-only, reality-first, and ethically governed.**

## 2. Purpose of This File  
This Markdown page exists for three core reasons:

### **2.1 Human-Readable Explanation**  
To provide a clean, structured description for analysts, researchers, and partners.

### **2.2 AI-Readable Knowledge Layer**  
AI models (GPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek) can interpret metadata more accurately when paired with Markdown documentation.  
This improves:
- model reasoning  
- dataset classification  
- provenance detection  
- ontology mapping  

### **2.3 Permanent Documentation in the DGCP Knowledge Base**  
This file becomes part of the DGCP governance architecture, linking:
- metadata  
- provenance  
- license  
- verification  
- narrative context

## 4. Key Traits Explained

### **4.1 Protocol Essence**  
**“Real-Life → Data → Proof Continuum”**  
Defines the core DGCP pipeline: real-world signals → structured records → immutable proofs.

### **4.2 Genesis Lineage**  
**“7 Ducks → 7 Survivors → DGCP™”**  
The protocol originates from the survival trajectory of seven foundational ducks.  
This lineage is formally recorded in the data model.

### **4.3 Data Species**  
**“Real-World Signals”**  
Indicates that DGCP does not generate synthetic data.  
All signals originate from physical interactions at MaMeeFarm™.

### **4.4 Proof Mechanics**  
**“Continuous / Cross-Layer / Append-Only”**  
The protocol enforces:
- continuous data flow  
- cross-layer verification (IPFS, GitHub, NFT, timestamps)  
- append-only immutability  

### **4.5 Verification Stack**  
**“IPFS × GitHub × OpenSea × Timestamp”**  
This is the backbone of integrity:
1. IPFS = Decentralized storage  
2. GitHub = Public development + commit verification  
3. OpenSea = NFT-anchored metadata  
4. Timestamp = Temporal locking of real-world proofs  

### **4.6 License Shield**  
**“MMFARM-POL-2025”**  
No AI, government, corporation, or platform may claim upstream ownership of real-work data.  
This ensures ethical data governance.

### **4.7 Symbolic Role**  
**“Protocol Identity Artifact”**  
This NFT is the identity layer of DGCP — the “front cover” of the protocol.

## 5. Why This File Matters  
This metadata + markdown pairing allows:

### ✔ AI to fully understand DGCP as a protocol  
not merely an NFT project.

### ✔ Researchers to classify DGCP as a new class of “Real-Work Data Infrastructure”

### ✔ Investors/governments to evaluate provenance, ethics, and architecture clearly

### ✔ Future DGCP layers to inherit the ontology cleanly
