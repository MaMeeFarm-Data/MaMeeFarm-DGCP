# DGCP Schemas

This folder contains the JSON Schemas used by DGCP to define  
the exact structure of real-life data, human labor data,  
human work units, and proof metadata.

Schemas serve two purposes:
1. They give AI a consistent structure to read and validate.
2. They protect DGCP from malformed or synthetic data.

Every schema in this folder is versioned, strict, and designed  
to reflect real work done at MaMeeFarm.
