# DGCP – MaMeeFarm Real-Life Data Protocol
Draft 1.0

DGCP began in a small corner of Lampang, where daily work was simple:
feed the ducks, check on the dogs, clean the yard, collect one egg,
and deal with whatever the day decided to bring.

Nothing here started as "a protocol."  
It started as survival, routine, and responsibility.

But when you record real work every single day without skipping,
you eventually see a pattern. And that pattern becomes structure.
Structure becomes rules. And rules become a protocol.

DGCP stands for **Duck Governance & Continuous Proof**.
It carries the history of the first seven ducks we cared for,
the days they lived, the days they struggled,
and the days we lost some of them.

Those moments became the first dataset we couldn’t rewrite.
And that’s where this protocol took shape.

---

## What DGCP Tries to Do
DGCP is a simple idea:
**record life and labor as they are — not as they “should” be.**

If it rains, we record that.
If the temperature drops to 22°C, we record that.
If a duck gets injured, we don’t hide it.
If one egg appears that day, that’s exactly what the record shows.

The protocol exists so that:
- real-life data has a structure  
- human labor is not invisible  
- every event is timestamped and traceable  
- the truth of daily life is preserved without filters  
- anyone can verify the work behind the data  

DGCP is not designed to look impressive.  
It is designed to stay honest.

## The Four Layers of the Protocol

### **1. Proof of Life (PoLIFE)**
Records from real days, real weather, real animals, real conditions.
It answers the question: *“What actually happened today?”*

### **2. Proof of Labor (PoLABOR)**
Records the effort behind each day:
chores, repairs, feeding, cleaning, moving, documenting.
It answers: *“What work was actually done?”*

### **3. Proof of Human Work (PoHW)**
Where life and labor meet.
PoHW verifies that the data came from a human being
doing real work in a real environment.
This is the heart of the protocol.

### **4. DGCP – Duck Governance & Continuous Proof**
The top layer.
It defines how the records are used, protected, stored,
and kept honest over time.
It is the rulebook of this entire system.

Together, these four layers create a way to record real-life data  
that cannot be replicated, simulated, or rewritten.

---

## Why This Exists
This protocol did not come from a lab, a company, or a grant.
It came from a farm that had no budget,
two people doing their best,
seven ducks that became history,
and the work that happened whether anyone looked or not.

DGCP is built on:
- daily commitment  
- real evidence  
- real timestamps  
- mistakes and corrections  
- survival and learning  
- and a long chain of proof you cannot fake

It’s a protocol made from effort, not from imagination.

## A Note for Anyone Reading This
Everything in this repository comes from real work.
Everything happened once.
Nothing was simulated.
Nothing was adjusted to look better.

If you study this protocol,  
you are looking at real life — not a demo.

If you want to adapt or extend DGCP, you are welcome to.
Just keep the original records untouched.
They matter because they are true.

DGCP   
A protocol shaped by the kind of work  
you wake up and do every day,
whether anyone sees it or not.

## License
All documents, structures, and records in this repository are released  
under the **MMFARM-POL-2025 License**.  
This license protects the integrity of real-life data,  
the rights of the people who created it,  
and the continuity of the protocol.

It allows study, reference, and adaptation,  
but does not allow altering or rewriting any historical record.  
Every event inside this protocol happened once,  
and must remain as it was.

## Maintainer
DGCP was created, documented, and maintained by  
**P’Toh – MaMeeFarm**  
from daily work on a real farm in Lampang, Thailand.

This protocol stands on real labor,  
real life, and the responsibility that comes with both.
---

## Why DGCP Updates Daily

DGCP is a living protocol.  
It changes because real life changes.  
Rain, temperature, animal health, labor effort, resource usage, and daily 
conditions are all part of the truth DGCP must preserve.

A protocol built on real work cannot be static.  
Each day requires one new line — a note, a proof, or a clarification — added 
without removing anything before it.

This is what gives DGCP integrity, continuity, and long-term value.

---

## Daily Notes (Append-Only)

2025-11-18 — DGCP updated with today’s proof; confirmed daily append-only workflow with minimal required additions.

*(Add a new line under this every day.  
Do not remove or edit previous entries.)*

---

## Protocol Guarantees

DGCP ensures that:

- every record inside this repository happened in real life,  
- no historical entry will ever be rewritten,  
- all updates move forward only (append-only),  
- the protocol grows through real labor and real evidence,  
- the original creator retains authorship and data rights under MMFARM-POL-2025,  
- readers anywhere in the world may verify the truth of the data.

These guarantees make DGCP trustworthy, auditable, and usable for future 
standards, products, and decentralized systems.

---

## How to Contribute

If you wish to extend DGCP for your own use:

1. Follow the append-only rule.  
2. Never modify previous records.  
3. Add new proofs or notes in your own fork.  
4. Respect the MMFARM-POL-2025 License.  
5. Maintain the integrity of real-life data.

DGCP is open to adaptation, but the truth of its origin must remain intact.

---

## Final Note

DGCP began as survival work on a small farm in Lampang.  
Today, it serves as a reference model for how real-life labor, products, and 
events can be documented without distortion.

What grew from daily responsibility has now become a protocol.

## 🌱 Overview
This repository is part of the **MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol**,

## 🌏 Why DGCP Exists

DGCP was created because real work disappears.

If a person feeds animals, carries water, cleans a farm, fixes a roof,
or survives a difficult day — none of that becomes data.
Nothing remains as evidence of the effort, the pain, the progress,
or the responsibility.

Modern systems only capture formal work:
salary slips, factory machines, online activity.
But real human labor — the kind done in farms, small homes,
villages, and everyday life — is invisible.

DGCP exists to fix that.

It records real labor, real life, and real condition as they happen,
without rewriting and without filters.
It gives small workers a way to prove their effort,
and gives future AI models a way to learn from reality,
not from synthetic data.

DGCP exists so that a normal day of work
will never again disappear without a trace.
