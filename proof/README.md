# Proof Collections

This folder defines how DGCP proof collections are structured.

A “proof collection” groups multiple real-life records,  
IPFS references, and on-chain links into a single, human-readable file.

Each collection:
- is named using an incremental pattern, e.g. `proof-001`, `proof-002`  
- links to real data stored in other systems (GitHub, IPFS, NFTs)  
- follows the Non-Rewrite Principle defined in DGCP governance  

This folder does not store the raw data itself.  
It stores **maps to evidence** that already exist.
