# DGCP Data Flow

The DGCP data flow preserves the truth from the moment it is captured.

### 1. Real-Life Capture
Data begins in the real world:
- photos  
- temperature  
- daily events  
- labor actions  
- conditions  

Captured once, without reconstruction.

---

### 2. Local Device
Files remain in their original form.
No editing. No retouching.

Metadata from the device is retained.

---

### 3. GitHub (Primary Evidence Layer)
Each file is uploaded with:
- original timestamp  
- commit history  
- file hash  
- structured folder placement  

GitHub preserves version history and public auditability.

---

### 4. IPFS (Permanent Storage Layer)
Selected files are pinned to IPFS.
This provides:
- content addressing  
- immutability  
- decentralized verification  

---

### 5. DGCP Proof
Hashes, timestamps, and file IDs are combined into a PoHW unit.

---

### 6. Optional: NFT Layer
Some proofs may be extended into NFTs on-chain  
without altering the original evidence.

---

**The flow exists to protect the truth of the moment it came from.**
