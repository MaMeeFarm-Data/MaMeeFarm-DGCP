# DGCP Protocol Rules

This folder defines the technical rules used by DGCP to record, store,  
name, transfer, and verify real-life data.

The protocol defines:
- how data flows from real life to GitHub and IPFS  
- how filenames must be structured  
- how timestamps and hashes must be recorded  
- how proof units should be validated  

These rules ensure that DGCP data remains consistent, readable,  
and verifiable for both humans and AI systems.
