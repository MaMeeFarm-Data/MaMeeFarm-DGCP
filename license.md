# MMFARM-POL-2025 License  
### MaMeeFarm Proof-of-Labor License  
Version 1.0 (2025)

This license was created to protect real-life data collected at MaMeeFarm.  
All records inside this protocol come from actual human work,  
daily routines, and events that happened once and cannot be repeated.  
Because of this, the data requires a form of protection  
that respects both the work and the truth it represents.

---

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this license is to:
- Protect the integrity of real-life and real-labor data  
- Ensure that historical records remain unchanged  
- Allow others to study, reference, or build upon the protocol  
- Prevent misuse, distortion, or commercial exploitation of the data  
  without proper context and credit  

DGCP and all related proof layers (PoLIFE, PoLABOR, PoHW)  
were developed from actual work done at MaMeeFarm.  
This license exists so that the truth within those records stays intact.

## 2. What You Are Allowed To Do
You may:
- Read, study, and analyze any part of this repository  
- Reference the protocol in research, articles, or documentation  
- Build tools, ideas, or systems inspired by the protocol  
- Use the structure and concepts for educational purposes  
- Adapt the protocol logic for your own work  
  *(as long as historical records remain untouched)*

No permission is needed for non-commercial use.

## 3. What You Are Not Allowed To Do
You may NOT:
- Alter, rewrite, edit, or delete any historical data in this repository  
- Remove timestamps, filenames, proofs, or event records  
- Use the data for commercial products without permission  
- Present DGCP data as your own  
- Replicate or simulate historical records as if they were original  
- Use any part of the protocol to mislead others about its origin  

These restrictions exist because every record inside DGCP  
comes from real life, real work, and real consequences.

## 4. Attribution
If you use or reference this work,  
credit must be clearly given as:

**“DGCP Protocol by MaMeeFarm (P’Tōh)”**

Attribution is required for:
- Research papers  
- Technical documents  
- Presentations  
- Derivative protocols  
- Any system built on top of DGCP concepts  

This protocol was developed through daily labor,  
not theoretical design,  
and the attribution acknowledges that effort.

---

## 5. Commercial Use
Commercial use of DGCP data, structure, or methods  
requires written permission from:

**P’Tōh — MaMeeFarm  
Lampang, Thailand**

Commercial use includes:
- Products  
- Software  
- Platforms  
- Subscription services  
- Machine learning datasets  

A separate license agreement will be required.

---

## 6. Integrity Rule (Append-Only)
All historical records inside this repository  
must remain in append-only form.

This means:
- No edits  
- No corrections  
- No polishing  
- No removal of imperfect data  

The value of DGCP comes from its accuracy,  
not from perfection.

---

## 7. Limitation of Liability
MaMeeFarm provides this protocol “as is,”  
with no guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose.  
Users are responsible for how they interpret  
or build upon the protocol.

The creators are not liable for:
- Misuse by third parties  
- Incorrect interpretations  
- Derivative works  
- Technical failures outside this repository  

---

## 8. Closing Statement
DGCP was not created in a laboratory.  
It was created through real work,  
in a real farm,  
by people who had to show up every day  
whether anyone was watching or not.

This license protects that truth.
