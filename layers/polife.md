# Proof of Life (PoLIFE)

PoLIFE captures what actually happened in the real world.
It includes daily conditions, temperature, events, moments,  
and anything that occurred in real time without reconstruction.

PoLIFE is the environmental truth.
It answers the question:  
“What was the state of the world at that moment?”

PoLIFE data is always:
- real  
- timestamped  
- contextual  
- captured once  
- never rewritten  

This layer represents the lived environment of MaMeeFarm.
