# DGCP Layers

DGCP is built on four layers of real-world truth.
Each layer captures a different part of human life and human work.
Together, they form a complete system of verifiable reality.

Layers included in this folder:
- PoLIFE — real-life events and environment
- PoLABOR — human effort and daily work
- PoHW — combined human work units
- DGCP Overview — protocol layer governing all others

Each document in this folder explains one layer in detail.
