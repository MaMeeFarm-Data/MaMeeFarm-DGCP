# Proof of Human Work (PoHW)

PoHW is the point where life and labor meet.

It combines:
- the environment (PoLIFE)
- the effort (PoLABOR)

into a single unit of human work.

PoHW answers the question:  
“What human work existed in this moment of reality?”

A PoHW unit must always include:
- real-life context  
- human labor  
- timestamps  
- hashes  
- verification  

PoHW is the core validation layer of DGCP.
It ensures the data came from:
a real person, in a real place, doing real work.
