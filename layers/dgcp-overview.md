# DGCP Overview

DGCP is the governing layer above PoLIFE, PoLABOR, and PoHW.
It defines how real-life data is recorded, protected, referenced,  
validated, and allowed to evolve.

DGCP answers the question:  
“How do we preserve the truth without rewriting it?”

The DGCP layer defines:
- rules of record creation  
- file structure  
- acceptable formats  
- naming conventions  
- verification requirements  
- governance connections  
- immutability rules  

DGCP ensures that:
- evidence remains evidence  
- timestamps remain original  
- truth cannot be reshaped  
- data cannot be appropriated  

This layer is the protocol's backbone.
