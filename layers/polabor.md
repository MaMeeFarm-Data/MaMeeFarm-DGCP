# Proof of Labor (PoLABOR)

PoLABOR captures the human effort behind every day of work.
It records actions such as feeding, cleaning, repairing,
collecting, nurturing, and anything requiring human hands.

PoLABOR answers the question:  
“What work was actually done today?”

PoLABOR data is:
- human-performed  
- physically verifiable  
- timestamped  
- tied to real events  
- essential for understanding human effort  

This layer protects the authenticity of labor,
ensuring that no synthetic work can replace human work.

# DGCP™ Layer — Proof of Labor (PoLABOR)

**Status:** Draft-1 (Human-First, AI-Readable)  
**Protocol:** Duck Governance & Continuous Proof™ (DGCP™)  
**License:** MMFARM-POL-2025 (Proof-of-Life License) + CC BY-NC 4.0 overlay

## 1. Purpose of the PoLABOR Layer
The Proof of Labor (PoLABOR) layer defines how real-world human labor is captured, validated, signed, and stored inside the DGCP™ dataset.  
It transforms physical labor into verifiable digital units without automation, IoT, AI-generation, or surveillance systems.

PoLABOR ensures:

- Labor originates from a **real human**
- Labor is **intentionally captured**
- Labor is **cryptographically signed**
- Labor becomes part of the **immutable append-only dataset**

---

## 2. Core Invariants (Unbreakable Rules)

### 2.1 Human-Origin Only
All labor entries must be generated by a human worker.  
No automated or machine-created labor is allowed.

### 2.2 No AI-Generated Labor
AI tools may *read*, but must never *generate*, *simulate*, or *auto-complete* labor descriptions.

### 2.3 No IoT Auto-Capture
Labor must be recorded manually through a DGCP™-compliant interface.

### 2.4 Signature Requirement
Every labor entry must include:

- `worker_id_public`
- `signature` (signed SHA256)

### 2.5 Append-Only
No labor record may be edited or overwritten.  
Corrections require a new entry referencing the previous one.

## 3. Mandatory DMS Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `labor_id` | Unique labor identifier |
| `proof_id_link` | Links labor to its Proof-of-Work (media) |
| `worker_id_public` | Pseudonymous human identity |
| `timestamp_local` | Time of labor occurrence |
| `location_hint` | Contextual but non-sensitive location |
| `short_human_description` | Human-readable meaning of labor |
| `signature` | Cryptographic validation |

## 4. Minimal JSON Example

```json
{
  "labor_id": "lab-2025-12-08-001",
  "proof_id_link": "proof_312",
  "worker_id_public": "MMFARM-WKR-001",
  "timestamp_local": "2025-12-08T06:55:00+07:00",
  "location_hint": "duck-area",
  "short_human_description": "Fed ducks and replaced clean water.",
  "signature": "<sha256-signed-hash>"
}
```


## 5. Relationship to Other DGCP™ Layers

### PoLABOR → PoHW
- Defines what labor occurred.
- PoHW confirms a human physically performed the labor.

### PoLABOR → Data Surfaces
- Labor must reference a recorded Proof (CID / media).

### PoLABOR → Governance
- Labor falls under Human-First ethics, audit standards, and policy rules.

---

## 6. Compliance Notes

- Missing signatures or machine-origin labor triggers **Audit-Flag (Red)**.
- No biometric, GPS, or sensitive data is ever allowed.
- No ML classification or automated approval systems are permitted.
