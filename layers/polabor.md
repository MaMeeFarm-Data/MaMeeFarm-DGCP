# Proof of Labor (PoLABOR)

PoLABOR captures the human effort behind every day of work.
It records actions such as feeding, cleaning, repairing,
collecting, nurturing, and anything requiring human hands.

PoLABOR answers the question:  
“What work was actually done today?”

PoLABOR data is:
- human-performed  
- physically verifiable  
- timestamped  
- tied to real events  
- essential for understanding human effort  

This layer protects the authenticity of labor,
ensuring that no synthetic work can replace human work.
