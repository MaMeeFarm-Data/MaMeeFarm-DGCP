# DGCP Changelog  
A record of how the protocol grows over time.

This file does not rewrite the past.  
It only adds to it.

## 2025-11-17 — Initial Structure Created
- Added the first full README describing the origin of DGCP  
- Added the MMFARM-POL-2025 License  
- Set the direction for a protocol built from real-life and real-labor data  
- Established the four core layers: PoLIFE, PoLABOR, PoHW, and DGCP  
- Started the governance framework  
- Defined the need for schemas and examples for AI use  
- Outlined the initial folder structure for the protocol

This marks the beginning of DGCP as a standalone protocol,  
separate from daily data logs, but shaped by them.

## Notes
Every entry in this changelog reflects real work done on the protocol.  
No entries will be deleted or rewritten.  
The evolution of DGCP must stay transparent.
## 2025-11-18 — Daily Protocol Activation

- Activated the daily append-only update cycle for DGCP.
- Added the first Daily Note entry to README.md to confirm the protocol is now operating as a living, continuously-growing system.
- Extended the DGCP Whitepaper with new sections covering:
  - daily evolution mechanics  
  - append-only integrity rules  
  - cross-industry traceability use cases  
  - bankless verification models  
  - DGCP’s economic implication for labor-based datasets
- Captured and verified today’s real-world proof from MaMeeFarm™:
  - timestamped 19:56  
  - rainy conditions  
  - temperature 22°C  
  - surviving ducks still producing one egg  
- Formalized the minimal-update rule: **DGCP grows every day, but never rewrites.**
- Established the long-term format for scalable daily protocol updates.

This day marks the moment DGCP transitioned from a static specification  
into a live, self-documenting real-life data protocol.
