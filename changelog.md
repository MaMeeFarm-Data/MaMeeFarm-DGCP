# DGCP Changelog  
A record of how the protocol grows over time.

This file does not rewrite the past.  
It only adds to it.

## 2025-11-17 — Initial Structure Created
- Added the first full README describing the origin of DGCP  
- Added the MMFARM-POL-2025 License  
- Set the direction for a protocol built from real-life and real-labor data  
- Established the four core layers: PoLIFE, PoLABOR, PoHW, and DGCP  
- Started the governance framework  
- Defined the need for schemas and examples for AI use  
- Outlined the initial folder structure for the protocol

This marks the beginning of DGCP as a standalone protocol,  
separate from daily data logs, but shaped by them.

## Notes
Every entry in this changelog reflects real work done on the protocol.  
No entries will be deleted or rewritten.  
The evolution of DGCP must stay transparent.
