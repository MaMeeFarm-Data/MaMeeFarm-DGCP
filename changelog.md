# DGCP Changelog  
A record of how the protocol grows over time.

This file does not rewrite the past.  
It only adds to it.

---

## 2025-11-17 — Initial Structure Created
- Added the first full README describing the origin of DGCP  
- Added the MMFARM-POL-2025 License  
- Set the direction for a protocol built from real-life and real-labor data  
- Established the four core layers: PoLIFE, PoLABOR, PoHW, and DGCP  
- Started the governance framework  
- Defined the need for schemas and examples for AI use  
- Outlined the initial folder structure for the protocol

This marks the beginning of DGCP as a standalone protocol,  
separate from daily data logs, but shaped by them.

## Notes
Every entry in this changelog reflects real work done on the protocol.  
No entries will be deleted or rewritten.  
The evolution of DGCP must stay transparent.
## 2025-11-18 — Daily Protocol Activation

- Activated the daily append-only update cycle for DGCP.
- Added the first Daily Note entry to README.md to confirm the protocol is now operating as a living, continuously-growing system.
- Extended the DGCP Whitepaper with new sections covering:
  - daily evolution mechanics  
  - append-only integrity rules  
  - cross-industry traceability use cases  
  - bankless verification models  
  - DGCP’s economic implication for labor-based datasets
- Captured and verified today’s real-world proof from MaMeeFarm™:
  - timestamped 19:56  
  - rainy conditions  
  - temperature 22°C  
  - surviving ducks still producing one egg  
- Formalized the minimal-update rule: **DGCP grows every day, but never rewrites.**
- Established the long-term format for scalable daily protocol updates.

This day marks the moment DGCP transitioned from a static specification  
into a live, self-documenting real-life data protocol.

## 2025-11-19 — Multi-Layer Expansion & Device-Origin Proof Day

- Added Section 15 (Real-Work Value Layer Model) to DGCP Whitepaper V1  
  to define the economic value model derived directly from human labor.

- Expanded the Governance Protocol with:
  - Multi-Layer Truth Assurance (MLTA)
  - clarification notes for missing commit descriptions  
    caused by mobile device limitations (append-only compliance)

- Strengthened the Device-Origin Verification rules  
  after multiple real-world cases of mobile-device instability  
  highlighted the importance of raw timestamps and unedited metadata.

- Verified today’s real-world proof from MaMeeFarm™:
  - timestamped evidence files captured via mobile device
  - proof of returning duck (unexpected survival event)
  - rainy conditions affecting workflow
  - daily animal-care labor still performed despite device failures

- Documented human-context events:
  - accidental commits without extended descriptions  
  - mobile touch-screen errors  
  These were added as immutable governance notes  
  to preserve the truth of daily work conditions.

- Reinforced the append-only principle with new governance entries  
  describing how errors are treated as authentic protocol data.

- Continued the DGCP “grow daily” rule:  
  real life changes → protocol expands → never rewriting the past.

This day shows that DGCP evolves not only from planned updates,  
but also from unpredictable real-life conditions such as device errors,  
weather, and animal events.  
DGCP grows because life grows.
