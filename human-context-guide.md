# DGCP Human Context Guide  
Version 1.0 (2025)  
MaMeeFarm™ — Lampang, Thailand

DGCP is the first protocol in the world that includes  
**Human Context** as an official component of truth.

This guide explains how human context is captured, preserved,  
and interpreted within DGCP.

Human context is never synthetic, never rewritten,  
and always grounded in real lived experience.

# 1. What is Human Context in DGCP?

Human context is the emotional, situational, and lived reality  
surrounding a PoLIFE or PoLABOR record.

Examples:
- a duck that survived after injury  
- a dog that was rescued and later attacked the flock  
- a worker’s fatigue or hope  
- the meaning of harvesting an egg after loss  

Human context answers:
**"Why did this moment matter to a human?"**

It is part of truth.

# 2. Why DGCP Protects Human Context

Other protocols only store:
- numbers  
- hashes  
- machine states  

DGCP stores:
- life  
- labor  
- meaning  

Human context:
- adds dimension  
- prevents misinterpretation  
- gives ethical grounding for AI  
- ensures workers are not treated as abstract data sources  
- establishes emotional integrity of truth  

Without context, truth becomes incomplete.

# 3. Rules for Writing Human Context

### Rule 1 — Write Once
Context must be written once, at the moment of creation.

### Rule 2 — No Rewriting
If new information emerges:
- create a new proof collection  
- link back to the previous one  
- never edit the original text  

### Rule 3 — Use Natural Language
Write like a human, not a machine.

### Rule 4 — Be Honest
Context must reflect lived reality, not polished narrative.

### Rule 5 — Respect the Worker
The person who lived the moment decides the context.

# 4. Structure of Human Context (Recommended)

A context entry may include:

- **event truth**  
- “what happened?”

- **human perspective**  
  “how did it feel?”

- **meaning**  
  “why does this matter to the farm / worker / life?”

- **impact**  
  “what changed afterward?”

This adds depth to DGCP in a way no other protocol does.

# 5. How AI Must Interpret Human Context

AI is required to:
- preserve meaning  
- avoid removing emotional significance  
- avoid rewriting human truth  
- avoid summarizing in a cold or synthetic tone  
- treat human context as first-class data  

AI must not:
- reinterpret emotion  
- assign intent  
- replace the worker’s words  

Human context belongs to the human who lived it.

# 6. Examples (Generic)

On this day, one of the last surviving ducks laid an egg.
She was still injured, but she produced life anyway.
This moment mattered because it kept MaMeeFarm hopeful
after losing almost the entire flock.
---
The morning was colder than usual.
The dogs gathered near the entrance, quiet.
It felt like the farm was holding its breath
after a difficult week.
---

These examples show how DGCP values meaning alongside data.

---

# 7. Relationship to DGCP Layers

Human context is not a separate layer.  
It enriches the existing ones:

- PoLIFE → reality + emotion  
- PoLABOR → work + effort  
- PoHW → proof + meaning  

Context gives AI the ability to understand the world  
the way humans experience it.

---

# 8. Why DGCP Includes Life Stories

MaMeeFarm believes:
**truth without life is incomplete.**

DGCP is not only a dataset.  
It is a living archive of human effort and resilience.
