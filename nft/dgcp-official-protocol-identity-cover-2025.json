  "description": "DGCP™ — Duck Governance & Continuous Proof™\nis the world’s first real-life data protocol born directly from\na survival event inside MaMeeFarm™.\n\nNot theory.\nNot simulation.\nNot AI fabrications.\nThis protocol emerged because real animals lived, vanished, suffered,\nand survived — and their evidence demanded a system that could not lie.\n\nThis cover represents the identity of DGCP™\nand the moment when real life became structured, timestamped,\ncross-verified, and permanently anchored into multi-layer proofs.\n\nAppend-only.\nReality-first.\nEthically governed.\nProtected under MMFARM-POL-2025 (Proof-of-Life License).\n\nThis is not merely an image.\nIt is the emblem of a protocol that cannot be faked.",
